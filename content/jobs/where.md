Our office is located in Macedonia, in the city of Gevgelija.  

Why Gevgelija? Because, like many people, we are tired of big congested cities. We believe that pollution, commuting difficulties, and stressful crowd curb dramatically our capacity to be creative, joyful and productive. 
Gevgelija offers sunny weather, proximity to nature and has a strong sense of community.  
Above all, you avoid traffic jam and can go to work by foot and save a serious amount of money as the cost of living is XX% cheaper than in Skopje!  

The city is surrounded by really cool point of interest so you can enjoy your weekends with family or friends. The eventuality of a crazy weekend in Thessaloniki organized by Ludo after-party team is not to be excluded ðŸ•¶.
