As Napoleon once said: "*Money is the sinews of war"*. 

We believe that salary is the best compensation for our employees. So how do we proceed?

- *What we will not do*: make you a so-called competitive offer, or trying to lure you with the promise of an opaque bonus at the end of the year.

- *What we do*: we will make a top of the market offer based on your skill going far enough to pay more than anyone else likely would, simple.

On top of that, we also provide the best perk of the market according to our Values.

*What we will not do*: provide unclear qualitative benefits like "good work atmosphere" or "opportunity for growth"

*What we do*: we give only crystal clear perks

- The opportunity to work with stunning colleagues, ready to expand and share the knowledge, in close relationship with our French CTO.

- Life-long self-improvement: 2 days of paid training/month.

- Top notch equipment: Apple MacBook Pro, flexible workspace design. 

- The guarantee of working with the most exciting open source technologies.
