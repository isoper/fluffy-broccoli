ðŸš€ Boldness & Innovation
==========================
LUDÅŒ is not meant to be yet another agency. We do not thrive on imitation of
what has already been done and are constantly looking for revisiting 
what limitations are. 
We dare and put strong emphasis on creativity.

- You always challenge your own solution and design as much as those of your peers in the pursuit of efficiency.
- You do not decree current state of the art as a boundary and always try to push it further.
- Though, you know when to step back to keep your goals in sight. Good enough is fine.
