ðŸ’ª Self-awarness & Team work
===============================
> The selfish is born for himself alone, the collective man is born for his fellow men.  
*Alphonse de Lamartine*
- You feel responsible for your surrounding's growth as much as yours.
- You are keen to share humbly your knowledge and experiences. You are humbled by the skills of your peers.
