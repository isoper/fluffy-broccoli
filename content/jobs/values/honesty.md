🙏 Honesty & Compassion
=========================
> The worst effect of artificial politeness is that it teaches us how to dispense with the virtues it imitates.  
*Jean-Jacques Rousseau*

At LUDŌ we build the kind of atmosphere that fosters personal growth 
and best decision-making. 
None of this is possible without genuine honesty and compassion.

- You owe yourself, your peers and our customers the truth, beyond your own prejudice.
- You only act toward our goals and greater good and do not shy away from recognizing your own mistake quickly.
