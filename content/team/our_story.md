Having roots in Macedonia I realized that the younger generation
was embracing the new technology fast and was eager to sharpen
their skills on the latest technologies in the IT sector.

Nevertheless, due to various factors in the economy, the
opportunity for our youth is scarce as a vast majority of
the incumbent IT firm prefer to take big old
corporate projects with old technology but a safe dividend.

As a consequence, I was thinking, what if we could empower these young
ambitious and talented people to develop themselves to the fullest extent by
offering them the opportunity to work on these big challenging projects that
French leading startups are facing right now, without the need for them to
leave the country?  

Fortunately, This is where my road crossed the one of our talented
CTO Bruno Pereira!
