Having roots in Macedonia I realized that the younger generation
was embracing the new technology fast and was eager to sharpen
their skill with the latest trend in the IT sector.

Nevertheless, due to various factor in the economy, the
opportunity for the young talented professional is scarce as a
vast majority of the incumbent IT firm prefer to take big old
corporate projects with old technology but safe dividend.

I began to think, what if we could empower these young
ambitious and talented people to develop themselves to the fullest
extent by exposing them on these big challenging projects that
French leading startup face right now without the need for them to
leave the country? At the end of the day he questioned himself
will I make a meaningful impact on society rather than just
climbing the ladder of financial career with the privileged one?

Fortunately, This is where his road crossed the one of our leading
CTO and Guru Bruno Pereira!
