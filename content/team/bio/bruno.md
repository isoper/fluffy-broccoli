As far as I can go, technology has always been part of my life. From my early days with my first computer using Linux, upto my professionnal carrer, 
passing by my time as a student at Pierre Et Marie University (Paris), I have developed a deep 
interest into technologies and building software.

Now after several years learning from the best startup from the french ecosystem and leading teams on technical changes over there,
I want to share my passion for computer science and my expertise with our clients and our teammates.
