I come from a strong background in economics & finance at the Sorbonne University (Paris)
and specialized in corporate finance at the Em Lyon Business School (Lyon).

As a naturally curious individual, I am keen to learn and have traveled through 
various branches of Finance: finance consulting mission, transaction advisory service 
in mergers & acquisitions, asset management, and Leveraged buyout at a private equity fund.

Having experiences on almost all type of firm, start-up and corporate I am helping 
clients' business to reach their next step.
