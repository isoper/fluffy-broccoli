I come from a strong background in economics & finance at the Sorbonne University (Paris)
and specialized in corporate finance at the Em Lyon business school. 
I am a naturally curious individual keen to learn. I went through almost all branches of Finance; 
finance consulting, transaction advisory service in mergers & acquisitions, 
asset management and mid-caps private equity fund.
